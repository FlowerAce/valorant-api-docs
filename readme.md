# Valorant API Docs

### **To read documentation and get started, go to <https://valapidocs.techchrism.me>**

This is a project designed to automatically document Valorant endpoints based on a typescript module describing endpoints and types.
This module is published on npm so it can be consumed from other projects to use the types, generate documentation, or generate api code.

To contribute to the code generating the documentation, see the `web` directory.
To contribute to the underlying data and types, see the `valorant-api-types` directory.
Modifications to the `docs` directory will be removed automatically.
