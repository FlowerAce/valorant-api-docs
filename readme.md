# Valorant API Docs

**To read documentation and get started, see [Docs](docs)**

This is a project designed to automatically document Valorant endpoints based on a JSON file containing endpoint data.
Documentation comes in the form of markdown files and importable Insomnia workspaces.

To contribute to endpoints / docs, see the `data` directory.
To contribute to the code generating the documentation, see the `generation` directory.
Modifications to the `docs` directory will be removed automatically.
