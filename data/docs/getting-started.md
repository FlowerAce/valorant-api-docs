# Getting Started

One of the easiest ways to get started and get a feel for what kinds of data you can get from the apis is to play around
with the requests yourself in a REST client like Insomnia.

 - Download and install Insomnia here: [https://insomnia.rest/download](https://insomnia.rest/download)
 - Go to Application -> Preferences -> Plugins and add the plugin `insomnia-plugin-valorant`
 - From the dashboard, click "Create", then import from url and enter `todo: json url`

To learn about how to make the API request yourself, check the "Docs" tab on any request.
